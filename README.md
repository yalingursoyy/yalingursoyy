## Hi there,
my name is YalÄ±n, I am currently a student in Yeditepe University in Turkey. I love experimenting with different topics in development and engineering. I post some of my projects and experiments here.

### Topics I have mainly focused on:
* Back-end Development with various languages, mostly C# and Java
* Object-Oriented Programming


### Topics I have played around with:
* Game Development with Unity (C#)
* Front-end Development with HTML and CSS
* Electronics such as Arduino Uno along with a breadboard, sensors and a LED screen
* Mobile development with Flutter

### Off-Topic interests:
* Linguistics (I only speak Turkish, English, and a bit of German at the moment, but I love learning everyday phrases from a language I don't know and hope I can build upon them:) )
* Aviation (Only in theory of course, I love to learn about basic aerodynamics and air traffic procedures)
* Chess (I have only been playing for just over a year now, I try to solve at least one puzzle a day)
* Cinema (I have plans for 3 short films which I want to shoot after I finalize the script and techniques I am going to use)
